# My Background
Here's a little backstory about me:

## The Beginning
I began my programming journey on a Raspberry Pi 3b.
My first projects including many small games with Pygame Zero in Python.
Eventually I found _Minecraft: Pi Edition_, and began to learn to use it's API.

After a variety of projects which are now lost to time, including some Sonic Pi,
and some of my very first real Pygame games, I learned the importance of proper file management.

## Plywood PC Era
I got a hand-me-down PC that was quite literally built on a piece of plywood.
With this, I continued my journey in Pygame, and learned a little C++.
I at some point remembered a game engine called 'Minetest' (Now called Luanti) that I had tried to get running on my Pi,
but had failed due to the limited memory (at least that's what I remember the issue to have been).
After installing this I began to learn the api, and lua at the same time (I never did fully learn lua).

## Welcome to The Future
The next summer after working a bit I got enough money to by myself parts for a new pc, which I built myself.
This is the PC that I now use, I run Manjaro, which is heavily ARCH based, but is better for a General Purpose PC.
As you will see if you check my repos, I made a lot of luanti projects, I even messed around with a game called 0AD,
which is moddable. (I don't advise you try that mod unless your PC is better than mine)

I don't now when I first got into Web Dev, but I've been doing several web site/app projects over the years.
In 2024, I particiapted in my first Luanti GameJam, placing 7th.

I have several projects currently in development, though life is pretty busy for me now.

# Languages

I have a small smattering of a variety languages.
A fully inclusive list of all the languages I've ever had anything to do with would be hard to make. But here is a list of some of them.

Compiled Langauges:
* C
* C++
* C#
* Go
* Java
* Erlang

Interpreted Languages:
* JavaScript
* Lua
* Python

Other Languages:
* HTML5, CSS, JSON
* MCFunction (Minecraft Datapacks)
* ASM (NASM)
* Shell Script

Though I am only mostly profficient in the following, the others are either only in certain cases or vary little:
* C, C++, C#
* Go
* Java
* JavaScript, HTML5, CSS
* Python
* Lua
* MCFunction
* Shell Script

# Projects

I tend to not stay working on one thing too much, which helps me not burn out.
This is not an inclusive list of my projects, rather it is a list of current projects that I am still developing

* Ephemeral (Pygame game)
* Wyrda (Luanti mod)
* Luanti Speedrun Tools (Luanti mod)
And other projects which are not public or aren't on Github at the moment.

Other projects I might come back to:

* OpalClient (Luanti fork)
* Reentry (Luanti Gamjam game)
* Lithium (Minecraft mod)
* Conquest (Pygame game)
* OpenCube (Craft Game fork)
* Europa (Luanti game)
